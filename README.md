Tokenization is a fundamental component in Large Language Models (LLMs), directly affecting computational efficiency, context length, and vocabulary management. Poor tokenization strategies can significantly inflate computation requirements, making optimization critical for models like GPT, LLaMA, and others. This project focuses on optimizing tokenization by moving beyond naive methods and implementing Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with additional regex-based preprocessing.

## Impact of Naive Tokenization

Traditional tokenization approaches, which split text at spaces or punctuation, lead to larger token sizes and inefficient handling of rare or unseen words. This bloats the modelâ€™s vocabulary size, leading to higher memory usage and computational demands, especially when processing longer sequences or handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

## Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for Vocabulary Efficiency

BPE reduces the vocabulary size by iteratively merging the most frequent pairs of subwords. This subword-level tokenization enables efficient encoding of rare and complex words without inflating the vocabulary, allowing the model to represent rare words as combinations of common subwords. The key advantages of BPE include:

- **Smaller Vocabulary Size:** Fewer distinct tokens mean reduced memory consumption and faster training times.
- **Improved Handling of Rare Words:** Instead of treating rare words as OOV tokens, BPE decomposes them into subword units, ensuring better generalization.
- **Effect on Context Length:** With a reduced vocabulary, more tokens can fit within a fixed context window. BPE optimizes the trade-off between vocabulary size and context length, allowing the model to handle longer input sequences efficiently while preserving context and improving overall performance.

## Regex-Based Preprocessing

Before applying BPE, regex patterns are used to preprocess and split text into meaningful subunits. This enhances the efficiency of the tokenization process by handling special cases such as punctuation, contractions, and compound words, ensuring cleaner subword units before merging via BPE. This two-step optimization minimizes tokenization errors and reduces unnecessary computation.

## Key Benefits

- **Computational Efficiency:** By optimizing tokenization, the model processes text with fewer, more meaningful tokens, reducing both training and inference time.
- **Memory Optimization:** A smaller, more efficient vocabulary reduces memory footprint, allowing for faster and more scalable model deployment.
- **Context Length Optimization:** Longer input sequences can be processed within the same context window, improving the model's ability to maintain context over extended text.
